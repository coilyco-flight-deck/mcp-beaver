# mcp-beaver - the ONE generic runtime image. It carries no guardfile: the spec is
# mounted or COPYed in by the consumer (deploy#40 / mcp-beaver#8's chart) and named
# on the command line. The same binary drives every `.mcp.kdl`; only the spec
# varies. The image serves MCP over HTTP/SSE and never binds stdio.

# umbra is a private forgejo module, fetched anonymously; GOPRIVATE keeps it
# off the public proxy/sumdb. The build is a CI consequence of a landed commit,
